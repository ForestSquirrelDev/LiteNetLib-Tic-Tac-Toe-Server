This is server implementation for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. It's based on .NET framework and [LiteNetLib](https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib) UDP library.
While developing the game, [LiteNetLib game example](https://github.com/RevenantX/NetGameExample) was used as a source of examples for LiteNetLib usage.

The repository is uploaded as is - it has not undergone any major refactorings. Whole purpose of the project was to familiarize myself a bit more with this part of game developer roadmap: ![image](https://github.com/ForestSquirrelDev/LiteNetLib-Tic-Tac-Toe-Server/assets/82777171/a2a6cdd5-e359-4bf9-a51a-c8e8c9d79a0e)

#### Features

- Classic Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay
- Authoritative server
- ECS-based game flow, made with my small custom [ECS library](https://github.com/ForestSquirrelDev/PoorMansECS)
- Request-response system on top of LiteNetLib
- Memes for lose, win and draw conditions, lol. Apologies for being a degenerate meme lord

In this video i enter the game with two separate Unity editor instances, connected to the local server, and switch between them in the process. Earrape warning ðŸ‘‚
